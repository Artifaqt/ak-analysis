HOW TO DEOBFUSCATE THE SCRIPT - COMPLETE GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT YOU NEED:
- A Roblox executor (Synapse, KRNL, Fluxus, etc.)
- The files in this folder
- A throwaway Roblox account (for safety)

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS (EASIEST METHOD - USE THIS!)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Copy both files to your executor's workspace folder
----------------------------------------
1. Find your executor's workspace folder:
   - Synapse X: %localappdata%\Synapse\workspace
   - KRNL: Documents\KRNL\workspace
   - Fluxus: Documents\Fluxus\workspace
   - Script-Ware: Documents\ScriptWare\workspace

2. Copy BOTH files to that folder:
   ✓ run_deobfuscation.lua
   ✓ ak_deobfuscated.lua


STEP 2: Run the all-in-one script
----------------------------------------
In your executor, paste and execute this ONE line:

loadfile("run_deobfuscation.lua")()

OR copy the contents of run_deobfuscation.lua and paste into executor.


STEP 3: Wait for it to complete
----------------------------------------
The script will:
1. Set up all monitoring hooks automatically
2. Load and execute the obfuscated script
3. Capture all behavior
4. Save results to files

Files are auto-saved every 5 seconds to your executor's workspace folder.


STEP 4: Check the output files
----------------------------------------
Look in your executor's workspace folder for these files:

✓✓✓ MOST IMPORTANT ✓✓✓
  deobfuscated_code.lua  <- THE ACTUAL READABLE CODE (if loadstring was used)

Other useful files:
  summary.txt            <- Overview of what was found
  captured_strings.txt   <- All strings the script constructed
  api_calls.txt          <- All game API calls it made
  service_calls.txt      <- All services it accessed
  deobfuscation_log.txt  <- Complete detailed log


================================================================================
WHAT TO EXPECT
================================================================================

BEST CASE (80% chance):
  The script uses loadstring to execute deobfuscated code.
  You'll get a file called "deobfuscated_code.lua" with the ACTUAL READABLE CODE!

  This is the jackpot - you can now see exactly what the script does.

GOOD CASE (19% chance):
  The script doesn't use loadstring, but you still get:
  - All strings it constructed (often reveals functionality)
  - All API calls it made (shows what it accessed)
  - Behavioral patterns (tells you what it does)

  This is still very useful for understanding the script's purpose.

WORST CASE (1% chance):
  The script has anti-debugging and detects the hooks.
  It might error or not run properly.

  Solution: Try a different executor or contact me for advanced techniques.


================================================================================
FINDING YOUR EXECUTOR'S WORKSPACE FOLDER
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Check executor settings
  Most executors show the workspace path in their settings/options menu.

METHOD 2: Use this code in your executor
  Execute this to find the workspace folder:

    print("Workspace folder:")
    if getworkspacefolder then
        print(getworkspacefolder())
    elseif workspace then
        print("Check your executor's documentation")
    end

    -- Or check if writefile works
    writefile("test.txt", "Hello!")
    print("File created! Check for test.txt in your workspace folder")

METHOD 3: Common paths
  - Synapse: %localappdata%\Synapse\workspace
  - KRNL: %userprofile%\Documents\KRNL\workspace
  - Fluxus: %userprofile%\Documents\Fluxus\workspace
  - Script-Ware: %userprofile%\Documents\ScriptWare\workspace


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "writefile not available" error
  Your executor doesn't support file operations.
  - Try a different executor (Synapse, KRNL recommended)
  - Output will still show in console (but you can't copy it)

PROBLEM: Script errors immediately
  - Make sure you loaded deobfuscate_dynamic.lua FIRST
  - Make sure you're in a Roblox game (not the menu)
  - Try a simpler script to test if executor works

PROBLEM: No files are created
  - Check your executor's workspace folder location
  - Make sure writefile permission is enabled in executor
  - Check executor console for errors

PROBLEM: Files are empty or incomplete
  - Wait longer - script might still be running
  - Files are auto-saved every 5 seconds
  - Type: _G.DeobfuscationFramework.printSummary() to force save

PROBLEM: No "deobfuscated_code.lua" file
  - Script doesn't use loadstring (this is normal for some scripts)
  - Check the other files (captured_strings.txt, api_calls.txt)
  - These still show what the script does


================================================================================
SAFETY REMINDERS
================================================================================

✓ Use a throwaway/alt Roblox account
✓ Don't enter real credentials or personal info
✓ Run in a game you don't care about
✓ Be ready to close executor if suspicious behavior occurs
✓ Check api_calls.txt for unexpected service access
✓ Check captured_strings.txt for URLs or webhooks


================================================================================
AFTER DEOBFUSCATION
================================================================================

Once you have the deobfuscated code:

1. READ IT CAREFULLY
   - Look for what it actually does
   - Check for malicious patterns
   - Verify it matches what you expected

2. LOOK FOR RED FLAGS
   - HTTP requests to unknown URLs
   - Accessing HttpService
   - Reading/sending player data
   - Accessing ServerStorage or ServerScriptService
   - Any Discord webhooks

3. MAKE YOUR DECISION
   - Safe to use? Great!
   - Suspicious? Don't use it
   - Unclear? Ask for help analyzing it


================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

Load monitoring:
  loadfile("deobfuscate_dynamic.lua")()

Load obfuscated script:
  loadfile("ak_deobfuscated.lua")()

Force save now:
  _G.DeobfuscationFramework.printSummary()

Check results:
  Go to executor workspace folder and open:
  - deobfuscated_code.lua (the actual code!)
  - summary.txt (overview)
