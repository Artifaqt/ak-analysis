## Successfully Processed (3 files, moved to readable/)

1. **animhub.lua** - Not from akadmin-bzk.pages.dev (GitHub source), not VM-obfuscated
2. **jerk.lua** - Simple loader, main script documented (remote URLs still MoonSec V3)
3. **sfly.lua** - Mobile + desktop versions merged

## Analysis Summary

### Downloaded Files Breakdown

**Total Commands in Registry:** 76+

**Downloaded Files:** 25
- VM-obfuscated with anti-tamper: 22
- Successfully processed: 3

**Not Downloaded Yet:** ~51 commands

### Protection Levels

**Luraph VM + Anti-Tamper (22 files):**
- All files in vm_obfuscated/ folder
- Cannot be deobfuscated without crashing
- Custom bytecode protection
- Active environment checks

**External Sources (3 files):**
- animhub.lua (GitHub) - Not VM-protected, successfully deobfuscated
- fpsboost (GitHub) - Not downloaded
- iy/Infinite Yield (GitHub) - Not downloaded

**Special Case (1 file):**
- jerk.lua - Simple loader, but loads MoonSec V3 protected remote scripts

### Why Only These Files Were Downloaded

The 25 files we have are likely:
1. Commands you (or previous user) executed in-game
2. Most commonly used commands
3. Commands tested during initial analysis

The remaining 51+ commands were never executed, so their scripts were never downloaded.

## Key Insights

### Pattern Recognition

**VM-Obfuscated Commands:**
- All scripts from akadmin-bzk.pages.dev domain are VM-protected
- Consistent protection: Luraph VM + anti-tamper
- Naming: Usually lowercase, sometimes capitalized first letter

**Readable Commands:**
- External GitHub sources (animhub, fpsboost, iy)
- Simple loaders that fetch remote content (jerk, sfly)

### Command Categories

**Movement/Physics:**
- !speed, !sfly, !flip, !gokutp, !ftp, !walkonair, !antislide

**Animations/Emotes:**
- !ugcemotes, !caranims, !animhub, !animcopy, !animlogger, !emotes, !jerk

**Reanimation:**
- !reanim, !r6, !r15

**Anti-Features:**
- !antiafk, !antivcban, !antikidnap, !antiall, !antibang, !antiheadsit, !antifling, !antivoid

**Social/Interaction:**
- !kidnap, !call, !stalk, !hug, !facebang, !touchfling, !uafling

**Utilities:**
- !chateditor, !chatlogs, !coloredbaseplate, !infbaseplate, !shaders, !spotify, !rizzlines, !akbypasser, !shiftlock

**Combat:**
- !swordreach, !fling, !naturaldisastergodmode

**Other:**
- !reverse, !friendcheck, !invis, !trip, !re, !voidre, !fastre, !shmost

## Conclusion

The command system downloads scripts on-demand when you execute them. We have 25 downloaded scripts because those are the ones that were executed at some point. The remaining commands would download their scripts when first used.

All scripts from the akadmin-bzk.pages.dev domain use Luraph VM obfuscation with anti-tamper protection, making them impossible to deobfuscate without triggering crash mechanisms.
